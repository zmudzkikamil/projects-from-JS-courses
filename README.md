These projects are created and designed by <ins><strong>Jonas Schmedtmann</strong></ins> (JS course from UDEMY). I rewrote these web apps from scratch.

By rewriting these website applications I learned:
- Object Oriented Programming paradigm,
- Functional Programming paradigm,
- ES6 features,
- working with modules,
- working with local storage,
- using parcel to transpile and polyfill code,
- using more advanced JavaScript (GET/POST REST API, objects prototype chain, closures etc.)
